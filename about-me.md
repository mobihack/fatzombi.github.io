I'm a programmer wannabe, i explored this world using a Nokia 2600 C-2 after hooked up into "DevStuff"
for years with the dream of becoming a web developer, learnt somewhat of html, css, JavaScript (before NodeJs),
in the years of soul searching & procrastinating i ended up here. these days i am learning lots of interesting fundamental stuff like Maths, Programming (in general), how OS happen
i am not a native english speaker, i will be logging my thoughts & stuff down at my blog, Keep me company :)
