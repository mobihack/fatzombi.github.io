Just another programmer with a little bit of web designing tricks. Interested in all things future (currently hooked on bulma.css) and everything fun. I am a constant learner of everything new (and simple :D). Will use this blog to log my thoughts and write stuff down as I encounter problems and discovery new &amp; awesome things through the path of learning!
